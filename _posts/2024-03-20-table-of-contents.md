## Short Introduction

My name is Ricardo Ruiz I am a software developer. I studied computer science and got my bachelor of science at FIU. 
I greatly enjoyed my classes and the topics taught at school. From graph theory to combinatorics and even a netcentric 
programming course. My passion has always been computers and feel in love with programming when I was a junior at highschool.  

Having said that I found a lack of real world applications for the concepts taught in school. I think everyone who has 
studied computer science could tell me what Dijkstra's algorithm is. But most people  may struggle to implement the algorithm. 
Or they have no even know where it can be applied, and what are some improvements of this algorithm. 

## Why read this Blog

There is no general topics that I will cover, it's pretty much anything that I find interesting. But the main idea
behind the blog is taking theoretical concepts and apply them in the real world. I mainly program in C++, Python, Rust, or Javscript
so code will be available from any of these. But the main ideas will be highlighted and can easily be translated to other languages.

I hope that some of the posts will encourage people to explore new concepts and try to experiment. The main audience of 
the post will be computer science students who have learnt these concepts, but are looking to expand beyond that. Even those
learning these concepts for the first thing can gain a lot from this blog.
