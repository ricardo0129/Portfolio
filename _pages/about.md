I am a graduate computer science student at FIU. I love working with computers and have all my life.
This is my personal website which acts as my portfolio with my blog.

I have several interest in the computer science field, but my main focus is on algorithms and data structures. 
I have done [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) for several years now and greatly enjoy it.
Some of my other interest include discrete mathematics, distributed systems, and theory of computation.
